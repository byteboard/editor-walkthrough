# Byteboard Environment Walk-Through

In order to ensure you are prepared to start your coding challenge, we would like to walk you through this coding environment.
You will be working in this environment to download, write, and submit your code.

Let's step through all of its components.

### The Side Panel
* This side panel is where you will always find your instructions.
* If you ever accidentally close this side panel, return to the Interview Details Document (the document you receive by email upon signing up to start your interview) to get the command for reopening it.

### The Terminal

* You can open and close the terminal window by clicking the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon> icon above this panel.
* To run a command listed in your instructions, click the  <walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon> icon on the right side of the code box below to paste the command directly into the terminal and push enter.

```bash
sh ~/editor-walkthrough/timer.sh
```
* When you start the interview a timer will appear like the one you now see at the bottom of the terminal window. 

### The Editor

*  You can open or close the editor by clicking on the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon> icon above this panel.
*  With the editor open, explore the source file for this walk-through by opening `walkthrough.md`.
*  Note, that any changes you make will be auto-saved.

*Other Tips:*
* If you are unfamiliar with the command line [here are some key Linux commands](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands).
* If you would like to change the editor's color theme go to File > Settings > Change Color Theme.
