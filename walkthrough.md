# Byteboard Environment Walk-Through

In order to ensure you are prepared to start your coding challenge, we would like to walk you through this coding environment.
You will be working in this environment to download, write, and submit your code.

Let's step through all of its components.

### The Side Panel
This side panel is where you will always find your instructions. If you ever accidentally close this side panel, return to the Interview Details Document (the document you receive by email upon signing up to start your interview) to get the command for reopening it.

### The Terminal

You will be able to run your code in the terminal panel at the bottom of the screen.
* Any commands you will need to run will be found in a black code box like the one you see below.
You can click the  <walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon> icon on the right side of the code box to paste the command in the terminal.
* You can open and close the terminal window by clicking the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-icon> icon above this panel.

Try running a command now:

```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

### The Editor

*  You can open or close the editor by clicking on the <walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon></walkthrough-cloud-shell-editor-icon> icon above this panel.
*  With the editor open, explore the source file for this walk-through by opening `walkthrough.md`.
*  Note, that any changes you make will be auto-saved.

*Other Tips:*
* If you are unfamiliar with the command line [here are some key Linux commands](http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=The-10-Most-Important-Linux-Commands).
* Note, when you start the interview and download your code a timer will appear at the bottom of your terminal window. 
* If you would like to change the color theme of the editor go to File > Settings > Change Color Theme.
